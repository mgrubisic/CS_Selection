Documentation of the workspace 'CyberShake_meta_data.mat'

This workspace has been created based on selected ground motions from the SCEC CyberShake platform. For details on the ground motion selection, see:

Baker, J. W., Goulet, C., Luco, N., Rezaeian, S., and Teng, G. (2020). “A Subset of CyberShake Ground Motion Time Series for Response History Analysis.” Earthquake Spectra, (in review).

 
Variables available in the workspace: 
 
Filename_1        : Filename of the time history data file in 				    direction 1
Filename_2        : Filename of the time history data file in 				    direction 2
dirLocation       : location of relavant directory in the archive
Periods           : Periods at which spectral accelerations have 				    been computed and stored in the workspace
Sa_1              : Spectral acceleration in direction 1
Sa_2              : Spectral acceleration in direction 2
Sa_RotD100        : Orientation independent two-component 					    spectral acceleration
Sa_RotD50         : Orientation independent two-component 					    spectral acceleration
closest_D         : Closest distance to the ruptured area
magnitude         : Magnitude
Site_Name		  : CyberShake site name
Site_Short_Name   : CyberShake site short name
soil_Vs30         : Vs30 value 
Source_Name	      : seismic source name

Additional ground motion metadata is available in the summaryTable.csv file in the archive described below.

To access the associated ground motions, you should first download the ground motion .zip file from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3875541. Then move the .zip file to the folder  where the Matlab code is located (one directory up from where this documentation file is), and extract it there. 

Then, when you set 'copyFiles = 1' in the main script, the software will know where to look for the ground motion time series.
